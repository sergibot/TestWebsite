            <p>
              When I tell someone that I completed a BA (/MA Ox) in Classics – that is, Ancient Greek and Latin
literature, language, and philosophy – before taking on an MSc degree in Computer Science, I usually
get a quizzical eyebrow or two. What does Plato have to do with Python? What do the humanities
have to offer the sciences, and vice versa? My response is, invariably, everything – and in both
directions. Technology is in effect a toolkit. The tools do not act on their own: humans can pick them
up and use them, and it is from this that any boon or harm will come.</p>
<p>
Humans can use tools to do great things: to save lives, to explore new dimensions, to make the
world a safer place. In attempting to reach these goals, however, a split often occurs due simply to
the continuation of a tradition in which study is boxed into distinct disciplines – a tradition which has
been useful but which in a growing array of domains is no longer valid. The extent to which
technology has involved itself in humanity’s everyday life means that there are urgent problems in
this joining of science and humanity. Many of these problems end up under the umbrella term
“cybersecurity”, simply for the reason that technology has met humanity in a way that endangers
any elements of society ranging from the international to the private and personal.
<p>Being lucky enough to find a Centre for Doctoral Training that shares my mindset, and to get onto its
PhD programme, I am eager to waste none of the opportunity that I have been given. Problems
abound at this intersect between disciplines: I will be focusing on an emergent technology whose
meeting with humanity will resonate across innumerable domains. A “Generative Adversarial
Network” is a type of Machine Learning invented in 2014 which has since catalysed the development
of “talking head” synthesis, among other technologies, producing convincingly realistic fake media
colloquially known as “deepfakes”. We have recently reached the stage at which this development
threatens the trust that we currently place in visual and auditory evidence. Until now, it has been
impossible or at least very costly to realistically fabricate, or to unnoticeably manipulate, such
evidence. A great number of systems will be at risk due to this nascent technology, and protections
need to be put into place as fast and as effectively as possible.
<p>My PhD research will evaluate the threat that this technology poses via the UK’s systems of news
propagation, and will attempt to propose low-cost technical solutions that would fix the problem in
the right way, alongside work supporting policy proposals that would implement such solutions. A
clue to understanding what “the right way” will be is the fact that the development of “deepfake
detection” technologies will be an arms race in which we must assume that we are behind our
opponent: this means that the only solutions will be found in ways that are relevant to the contexts
of the domains that this threatens. The context of each case will be a different complex systematic
blend of humanity and technology, which is part of what makes these problems such enjoyable and
rewarding challenges.
